## How to setup
Before doing the following steps, make sure you have the **selenium** module installed.
Run this command in CMD, terminal or PowerShell (if you don't already have the module installed):
```
pip install selenium
```
1. Check your Chrome version (if you don't know how to do that, check below). If you have V.83, you can use the chromedriver.exe given. However, if you don't have that Chrome version, simply download your chromedriver.exe from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
2. Leave chromedriver.exe in the main directory of the .py file as it's designed for that. However, if you'd like to have the chromedriver executable file in another directory, you can use the **executable_path** parameter at line 6.
3. Run the .py file!

## Check your Chrome version
1. Navigate to the three dots at the top right corner of Google Chrome.
2. Select "Help" and hit "About Google Chrome".
